## Introduction

Test Test

Germany has set ambitious climate targets: reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 65% by 2030 and achieving climate neutrality by 2045 @AliEbadiTorkayesh.2024. These regulatory goals are intended to guide policy implementation across all sectors. However, the pace of actual transformation remains insufficient. This discrepancy between the urgency of climate goals and the inertia of implementation has been described in the literature as the *adaptation gap* @Huitema.2016, UnitedNationsEnvironmentProgramme.2021. This gap is particularly pronounced in the transport sector, which accounted for around 22% of Germanyâ€™s total emissions in 2022 @AgoraVerkehrswende.2024, and where emissions have stagnated or even increased, in contrast to reductions observed in other sectors @EuropeanEnvironmentAgency.2024. Although Germany has committed to a fundamental restructuring of its transport system with the so-called *Verkehrswende* (transport policy transition), progress remains slow. As time, financial resources, and political capital are limited, it is important to understand which policies and improvements are most popular with the public and, therefore, the most politically feasible. At the same time, we need to better understand what informs policy preferences and, in particular, the role of individual attitudes and perceptions.

*Acceptability* is understood as an attitude, whereas *acceptance* describes a behavioural response @JensSchade.2003 @N.M.A.Huijts.2012. In contrast, *preference* describes a comparative evaluation and is only meaningful in relation to other available options. Preferences are considered observable through the ordering of alternative options and are foundational in theories of individual decision-making and collective choice @LinusMattauch.2016. In the context of democratic policymaking, policy choices are made within a constrained set of options. Citizens are not asked to evaluate measures in isolation but to express preferences between competing parties proposing policy bundles. Our study follows this logic by focusing on preferences for transport policy measures across modes, enabling an examination of how such preferences vary among citizens. We address three main research questions: (1) What common attitudinal profiles can be identified through exploratory factor analysis of a wide range of attitude questions, and how do they vary across respondents? (2) How do characteristics of the built environment, socio-demographic/economic attributes, and mobility behaviour shape preferences for infrastructure improvements across different modes? (3) What role do attitudinal classes play in shaping such policy preferences? In answering these questions, we also account for differences in response behaviour and data quality, recognising that factors such as speeding or uncertainty can bias attitudinal and preference estimates.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: First, we provide a more detailed review of the literature on attitudes and preferences for mode choice and transport policies. This is followed by a description of our data collection and survey design, which covers attitudinal factors, behaviour and policy preferences. Next, we outline our methodological approach before presenting our empirical results and concluding with a discussion of the main findings.

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
