 abstract = {In this study, we model the telework-commute distance decision process as a package choice, and use a latent segmentation approach to recognize that some individuals may choose their telework arrangement first and then choose their commute distance (their residential location), while others may adopt a reverse causal behavioral process. The latent segment modeling methodology combines a multiple discrete--continuous probit model for telework adoption/intensity as the proportion of monthly workdays worked from home, from the office, and from a variable third workplace, with a log-linear regression model for commute distance (the home-to-office distance). The data for our analysis is drawn from a 2022 survey of Texas residents. Results suggest that about 20{\%} of the population are likely ``movers'', whose telework choices led to a residential move that changed commute distance, while the other 80{\%} are ``stayers'', whose commute distance at their predetermined (to telework) residential location changed telework habits. We further quantify the impact of teleworking on commute distances by computing the expected commute distance for several telework distribution preferences. A shift from 100{\%} in-person work to 100{\%} home-based remote work increases average commute distance by 64.8{\%}, while working from a third workplace for any portion of a month reduces commute lengths relative to only home-based telework. In terms of monthly commute vehicle miles traveled (VMT), working from home for less than 18.6{\%} of the month (about once a week) per worker actually increases overall monthly commute VMT. Monthly commute VMT reductions become tangible only at about 30--40{\%} telework for each worker (about two days of telework per week for full-time workers with 22 workdays per month). In general, between 0 and 40{\%} home-based telework per worker (with the remaining percentage at the office), there is a 10{\%} commute VMT reduction for each 10{\%} increase in home-based telework. In the range of 40{\%} to 80{\%} home-based telework, there is about a 13{\%} commute VMT reduction for every 10{\%} increase in home-based telework. And in the range of 80{\%}-100{\%} home-based telework reduction, there is about a 15{\%} commute VMT reduction for every 10{\%} increase in home-based telework.},

@article{Czine.2024,
 abstract = {Heterogeneity in preferences can be addressed through various discrete choice modeling approaches. The random-parameter latent class (RLC) approach offers a desirable alternative for analysts due to its advantageous properties of separating classes with different preferences and capturing the remaining heterogeneity within classes by including random parameters. For latent class specifications, however, more empirical evidence on the optimal number of classes to consider is needed in order to develop a more objective set of criteria. To investigate this question, we tested cases with different class numbers (for both fixed- and random-parameter latent class modeling) by analyzing data from a discrete choice experiment conducted in 2021 (examined preferences regarding COVID-19 vaccines). We compared models using commonly used indicators such as the Bayesian information criterion, and we took into account, among others, a seemingly simple but often overlooked indicator such as the ratio of significant parameter estimates. Based on our results, it is not sufficient to decide on the optimal number of classes in the latent class modeling based on only information criteria. We considered aspects such as the ratio of significant parameter estimates (it may be interesting to examine this both between and within specifications to find out which model type and class number has the most balanced ratio); the validity of the coefficients obtained (focusing on whether the conclusions are consistent with our theoretical model); whether including random parameters is justified (finding a balance between the complexity of the model and its information content, i.e., to examine when (and to what extent) the introduction of within-class heterogeneity is relevant); and the distributions of MRS calculations (since they often function as a direct measure of preferences, it is necessary to test how consistent the distributions of specifications with different class numbers are (if they are highly, i.e., relatively stable in explaining consumer preferences, it is probably worth putting more emphasis on the aspects mentioned above when choosing a model)). The results of this research raise further questions that should be addressed by further model testing in the future.},

 abstract = {[To meet ambitious climate change goals governments must encourage behavioural change alongside technological progress. Designing effective policy requires a thorough understanding of the factors that drive behaviours. In an effort to understand the role of environmental attitudes better we estimate a hybrid choice model (HCM) for commuting mode choice by using a large household survey data set. HCMs combine traditional discrete choice models with a structural equation model to integrate latent variables, such as attitudes, into the choice process. To date HCMs have utilized small bespoke data sets, beset with problems of selection and limited generalizability.To overcome these problems we demonstrate the feasibility of using this valuable modelling approach with nationally representative data. Our results suggest that environmental attitudes have an important influence on commute mode choice, and this can be exploited by governments looking to add to their climate change policy toolbox in an effort to change travel behaviours.]},

title={Understanding the Demand for Travel: It's Not Purely 'Derived'},
year={2001},
month={Jan},
number={qt5bh2d8mh},
abstract={We contest the derived demand paradigm for travel as a behavioral absolute. To the contrary, we suggest that travel has an intrinsic positive utility and is valued for its own sake, not just as a means of reaching a destination. We argue that the same positive characteristics that lead people to engage in travel as a recreational activity in itself are likely to motivate them to engage in apparently excess travel in the context of their mandatory and maintenance activities as well. This paper explores the conceptual basis of a positive utility for travel, and presents some results from an ongoing empirical study of attitudes toward travel. In modelling distance traveled (in each of 11 categories), we found that subjective variables such as Travel Liking, the adventure-seeker Personality trait, the travel stress Attitudinal factor, and the Excess Travel indicator added considerable explanatory power to the Demographic variables traditionally used in such models. It appears that, far from being completely determined by demographically based needs, the amount of travel demanded is heavily influenced by one's attitudes toward travel. This is not only true for discretionary (entertainment) purposes, as would be expected, but for more \&quot;mandatory\&quot; purposes such as work/school-related activities as well. We are convinced that the demand for travel arises from a fundamental human need for mobility and other subjective characteristics, as well as from the external causes typically measured. To more accurately forecast travel demand and policy response, the role of those subjective characteristics needs to be understood much better than it is at present.},

@article{PatriciaL.Mokhtarian.2001,
 abstract = {This paper contests the conventional wisdom that travel is a derived demand, at least as an absolute. Rather, we suggest that under some circumstances, travel is desired for its own sake. We discuss the phenomenon of undirected travel -- cases in which travel is not a byproduct of the activity but itself constitutes the activity. The same reasons why people enjoy undirected travel (a sense of speed, motion, control, enjoyment of beauty) may motivate them to undertake excess travel even in the context of mandatory or maintenance trips. One characteristic of undirected travel is that the destination is ancillary to the travel rather than the converse which is usually assumed. We argue that the destination may be to some degree ancillary more often than is realized. Measuring a positive affinity for travel is complex: in self-reports of attitudes toward travel, respondents are likely to confound their utility for the activities conducted at the destination, and for activities conducted while traveling, with their utility for traveling itself. Despite this measurement challenge, preliminary empirical results from a study of more than 1900 residents of the San Francisco Bay Area provide suggestive evidence for a positive utility for travel, and for a desired travel time budget (TTB). The issues raised here have clear policy implications: the way people will react to policies intended to reduce vehicle travel will depend in part on the relative weights they assign to the three components of a utility for travel. Improving our forecasts of travel behavior may require viewing travel literally as a ``good'' as well as a ``bad'' (disutility).},

 abstract = {The availability of carsharing in cities around the world has allowed more households to take advantage of the service as an alternative or a complement to private car ownership. While most research has looked at the effect of carsharing on car ownership decisions using carsharing users' surveys, very few have modelled the choice of car ownership and carsharing jointly using independent surveys. This paper investigates the complex relationship between this joint decision, the built environment, and travel-related attitudes. Using data from two surveys in Montreal, latent-cluster analysis is used to identify a typology of residential neighbourhoods and a segmentation of attitude profiles. Cross-analyzing the two segmentations suggests that those with more positive attitudes towards the car are more likely to own cars and less likely to join carsharing across all neighbourhood types compared to less car-oriented profiles. However, people from all attitude profiles own fewer cars in more central neighbourhoods than in more suburban locations. Finally, a MNL model where sociodemographics and residential parking are controlled for confirms that both the built environment and attitudes independently influence the joint decision. Results also suggest that attitudes are associated with residential location choice, hinting at the presence of residential self-selection or environmental determinism. In summary, the analysis indicates that policy measures aimed at expanding carsharing vehicle availability for promoting carsharing as an alternative to car ownership may primarily impact individuals who are less drawn to the symbolic and emotional aspects of traditional cars.},

@article{LindaSteg.2005,
 abstract = {This paper reports results of two questionnaire studies aimed at examining various motives for car use. In the first study, a random selection of 185 respondents who possess a driving licence were interviewed. Respondents were recruited from the cities of Groningen and Rotterdam, The Netherlands. The sample of the second study comprised a random selection of 113 commuters who regularly travelled during rush hours in and around Rotterdam, a region in the west of the Netherlands. First, it was examined which categories of car use motives may be distinguished. As proposed by Dittmar's (1992) [The social psychology of material possessions: to have is to be. Havester Wheatsheaf, Hemel Hempstead, UK; St. Martin's Press, New York] model on the meaning of material possessions, results from both studies revealed that car use not only fulfils instrumental functions, but also important symbolic and affective functions. Second, it was studied to what extent these different motives are related to the level of car use. From the results of study 2, it appeared that commuter car use was most strongly related to symbolic and affective motives, and not to instrumental motives. Third, individual differences in the relative importance of the three categories of motives were investigated. In both studies, most group differences were found in the evaluation of the symbolic and affective motives (and not the instrumental ones). Especially frequent drivers, respondents with a positive car attitude, male and younger respondents valued these non-instrumental motives for car use. These results suggest that policy makers should not exclusively focus on instrumental motives for car use, but they should consider the many social and affective motives as well.},

 abstract = {Several research projects all over the world have considered transport pricing measures and policies as promising attempts to solve urgent traffic problems in urban areas. One important precondition for the successful implementation of pricing strategies is public acceptability. However, empirical findings have shown that the acceptability of such strategies is low. Until now economists have been looking for reasons for this refusal by analysing first of all socio-economic characteristics of the drivers concerned. But it is doubtful whether these alone have high explanatory value. Based on a heuristic acceptability model [IATSS Research 21 (1997) 134] different determinants of the acceptability of road pricing strategies are identified and analysed in more detail. A public acceptability survey was carried out in four European cities (N=952 motorists) to investigate two main questions. Firstly, how high is the current acceptability level of different urban transport pricing strategies? Secondly, do the factors as outlined in the acceptability model explain the level of acceptability? As expected, motorists' stated acceptability of the investigated pricing strategies is rather low. Concerning the factors influencing the degree of acceptability the analyses showed that in particular the variables `social norm', `personal outcome expectations' and the `perceived effectiveness' are positively related with the acceptability of pricing strategies. These variables account for nearly 40{\%} of the criterion variance and thus can explain acceptability of such measures much better than the socio-economic variables included.},

 abstract = {Vehicle ownership (VO) is of vital interest to transportation planning and policy, both in its own right and as a correlate of other travel-related behaviors. This study explores disaggregate relationships among socio-economic/demographic (SED) traits, the built environment (BE), and VO. Many previous studies have assumed that the importance of SED and BE variables to VO is homogeneous across the population, and have focused on the direct and mediated effects of those variables on VO. Here, we aim to account for heterogeneity in the effects of BE and SED, allowing those effects on VO to be moderated as a function of attitudes. Specifically, we use Latent Class Modeling (LCM), which probabilistically segments the sample so as to be homogeneous within and heterogeneous across segments, with respect to the choice process. Applied to a sample of 2385 commuters in Northern California, LCM outperforms an ordinary multinomial logit model and a deterministic segmentation model. The LCM identifies two classes: an ``auto-oriented'' segment, for which household size and income have stronger influences on vehicle ownership (compared to the other segment); and an ``urbanite'' segment, for which the BE generally has a stronger influence. This study contributes to better understanding the heterogeneity of an important travel-related choice process, and offers an alternative explanation to residential self-selection for an attitude-related endogeneity bias.},

 abstract = {The current study contributes to the literature by exploring the acceptance and controversy surrounding different transport policies, examining how public preferences/attitudes explain these dispositions in the context of transitions towards more sustainable transport systems. A random and representative Norwegian-population-based sample (n~=~1002) was used for the analysis purpose. A two-fold approach is employed. A principal component analysis is performed first to determine which transport policies (20 policies) are homogeneously evaluated. Secondly, a latent class analysis is used to classify unobserved subgroups of people and distinguish classes of acceptance/controversy patterns. We identify three distinct components of public evaluations of transport policies: ``traditional pull policies'' focusing on non-restrictive strategies such as incentives for public transport; ``car-based push policies'' focusing on actively limiting car use; and ``emerging policies'' focusing on innovative technologies such as electrification and automation. The latent class analysis uncovers six distinct classes, illustrating a spectrum of preferences and attitudes. These classes encompass individuals ranging from strong opposition and neutrality to strong support for various policy types. A highly environmentally conscious class, characterized by higher education levels, strongly supports diverse transport policies, including push and emerging measures, showcasing a commitment to sustainability and readiness for personal sacrifices. However, challenges arise from a class that strongly opposes all types of policies, including traditional pull measures. This class exhibits robust expectations and concerns about policy (features) impacts such as clarity, effectiveness, and fairness, and it is skewed towards a higher proportion of men, with relatively older members. Moreover, they have concerns that such policies might cause adverse consequences for them, such as additional travel time and reduced social interactions. In conclusion, the diverse patterns identified within the population highlight the need for a comprehensive approach to developing transport policies. For the transition towards more sustainable transport systems, the findings show potential for more radical transport policies compared to today's policy landscape.},

Comparisons of the two samples revealed similar psychological processes, including environmental concern, hazard/efficacy perception and car affection, whereas environmental knowledge seemed to have a subordinate role. Preferences of restrictions differed somewhat between the public, and the politicians and civil servants. It is suggested that local implementation of new strategies to reduce private car driving might benefit from a better understanding of what will be accepted among the public.

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the literature surrounding the implementation of controversial policies in transport, particularly in the context of road pricing. We then discuss various theories and mechanisms that contribute to an increase in support for such policies after real-world implementation. One significant factor is a change in attitude towards a policy. However, there are also other important factors, for example the utility experienced by people is not necessarily the same as the expected utility. In addition, people may be loss-averse relative to their reference point (often: their current situation). The disadvantages of a policy considered for implementation may be clearer than the advantages. Other factors discussed are the effect of the expected distribution of gains and losses, their magnitude, and perceptions of the processes being fair and competent. We then examine the implications of increased support after implementation, important lessons being that policymakers can anticipate growing support after implementation and that communication is key in the process of deciding on a controversial policy. In this regard, we propose that having a champion, or visionary, can be particularly effective in getting controversial policies accepted. Finally, we suggest avenues for future research.},

The experiences in Stockholm, where a trial period with congestion charges changed the public opinion from negative to positive, support this hypothesis. Analysing acceptability and attitudes in Stockholm allows us to study a situation where the population is in fact familiar with congestion charges, and explore what the decisive factors for acceptability are in such a situation. By analysing a survey collected after the referendum and the subsequent reintroduction of the charges, we analyse the prerequisites to achieve acceptability given that the public is familiar with congestion charges. As expected, low car dependence and good transit supply are associated with high acceptability. But the two most important factors turn out to be beliefs about the charges' effectiveness, and general environmental attitudes. The importance of beliefs and perceptions of the effects of the charges underscores the importance of both careful system design and careful evaluation and results communication. The strong connection between environmental concerns and positive attitudes to congestion charges underscores the importance of considering and ``marketing'' the charges' environmental effects. In Stockholm, the politicians' decision to ``re-label'' the congestion charges to ``environmental charges'' and emphasising their positive effects on air quality may very well have had a positive impact on acceptability.},

 abstract = {Appropriate microeconomic foundations of mobility are decisive for successful policy design in transportation and, in particular, for the challenge of climate change mitigation. Recent research suggests that behavior in transportation cannot be adequately represented by the standard approach of revealed preferences. Moreover, mobility choices are influenced by factors widely regarded as normatively irrelevant. Here we draw on insights from behavioral economics, psychology and welfare theory to examine how transport users make mobility decisions and when it is desirable to modify them through policy interventions. First, we explore systematically which preferences, heuristics and decision processes are relevant for mobility-specific behavior, such as mode choice. We highlight the influence of infrastructure on the formation of travel preferences. Second, we argue that the behavioral account of decision-making requires policy-makers to take a position on whether transport policies should be justified by appealing to preference satisfaction or to raising subjective well-being. This distinction matters because of the (i) influence of infrastructure on preference formation, (ii) health benefits from non-motorized mobility, (iii) negative impact of commuting on happiness and (iv) status-seeking behavior of individuals. The orthodox approach of only internalizing externalities is insufficient because it does not allow for the evaluation of these effects. Instead, our analysis suggests that transport demand modeling should consider behavioral effects explicitly.},

Public acceptance of these technologies is crucial for their successful introduction into society. Although various studies have investigated technology acceptance, most technology acceptance studies focused on a limited set of factors that can influence public acceptance, and were not based on a comprehensive framework including key factors influencing technology acceptance. This paper puts forward a comprehensive framework of energy technology acceptance, based on a review of psychological theories and on empirical technology acceptance studies. The framework aims to explain the intention to act in favor or against new sustainable energy technologies, which is assumed to be influenced by attitude, social norms, perceived behavioral control, and personal norm. In the framework, attitude is influenced by the perceived costs, risks and benefits, positive and negative feelings in response to the technology, trust, procedural fairness and distributive fairness. Personal norm is influenced by perceived costs, risks and benefits, outcome efficacy and awareness of adverse consequences of not accepting the new technology.

However, to implement effective policies, one must understand the motivations of people who use or do not use public transport today. In this study, we examine the psychographic profiles using latent class analysis to identify the reasons why people use or do not use public transport and link these profiles to reported travel behavior. For the latent class analysis, we use selected psychological items of the German Mobility Panel (MOP), a national household travel survey, that capture attitudes toward public transport. The results highlight four classes that differ based on their psychological profiles: PT-Averse, Privacy Aware Environmentalists, Pragmatists, and PT-Lovers. The results further show that Privacy Aware Environmentalists and PT-Lovers, who have a strong personal norm, frequently use public transport and environmentally friendly transport modes. Thus, the personal norm is a driver of public transport use. The lack of privacy, which the Privacy Aware Environmentalists complain about in public transport, is not a barrier to public transport use.},

Reviews of the professional literature have consistently found that many applications of EFA are marked by an injudicious choice of methods and incomplete reports. This article provides a systematic, evidence-based guide to the conduct of EFA studies that can be followed by researchers with modest statistical training, supplemented with an example to illustrate its application.},

 abstract = {We discuss the development of predictive choice models that go beyond the random utility model in its narrowest formulation. Such approaches incorporate several elements of cognitive process that have been identified as important to the choice process, including strong dependence on history and context, perception formation, and latent constraints. A flexible and practical hybrid choice model is presented that integrates many types of discrete choice modeling methods, draws on different types of data, and allows for flexible disturbances and explicit modeling of latent psychological explanatory variables, heterogeneity, and latent segmentation. Both progress and challenges related to the development of the hybrid choice model are presented.},

Preferences can be estimated more efficiently if respondents are asked to rank all alternatives. When some respondents are unable to perform the ranking task, using the complete ranking may lead to a substantial bias. We introduce a model which endogenously describes the ranking capabilities of individuals. Estimated preferences based on this model are more efficient when at least some individuals are able to rank more than one item, and they do not suffer from biases due to ranking inabilities of respondents.},

@article{LorenzoSeva.2022,
 abstract = {Nowadays, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses are two important consecutive steps in an overall analysis process. The overall analysis should start with an exploratory factor analysis that explores the data and establishes a hypothesis for the factor model in the population. Then, the analysis process should be continued with a confirmatory factor analysis to assess whether the hypothesis proposed in the exploratory step is plausible in the population. To carry out the analysis, researchers usually collect a single sample, and then split it into two halves. As no specific splitting methods have been proposed to date in the context of factor analysis, researchers use a random split approach. In this paper we propose a method to split samples into equivalent subsamples similar to one that has already been proposed in the context of multivariate regression analysis. The method was tested in simulation studies and in real datasets.},

It illustrates the effectiveness and flexibility of the recently developed exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) method, which integrates the advantages of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) into one complete measurement model. Two sets of data were collected using the L2 Passion Scale, which measures a dualistic model of passion. Study 1 participants were 220 L2 students. A comparison was made between the CFA and the ESEM models. The results demonstrated the superiority of the ESEM method relative to CFA in terms of better goodness-of-fit indices and realistic correlated factors. These results were replicated in another sample of 272 L2 students, providing support for the predictive validity using a structural ESEM model. Guidelines are provided and Mplus syntax files (codes) are included to help analysts apply the methods. We also make the data available publicly.~Overall, this research demonstrated the usefulness of ESEM for examining the construct, discriminant, and convergent validity of L2 scales over CFA.},

@article{Goretzko.2022,
 abstract = {Determining the number of factors in exploratory factor analysis is arguably the most crucial decision a researcher faces when conducting the analysis. While several simulation studies exist that compare various so-called factor retention criteria under different data conditions, little is known about the impact of missing data on this process. Hence, in this study, we evaluated the performance of different factor retention criteria-the Factor Forest, parallel analysis based on a principal component analysis as well as parallel analysis based on the common factor model and the comparison data approach-in combination with different missing data methods, namely an expectation-maximization algorithm called Amelia, predictive mean matching, and random forest imputation within the multiple imputations by chained equations (MICE) framework as well as pairwise deletion with regard to their accuracy in determining the number of factors when data are missing. Data were simulated for different sample sizes, numbers of factors, numbers of manifest variables (indicators), between-factor correlations, missing data mechanisms and proportions of missing values. In the majority of conditions and for all factor retention criteria except the comparison data approach, the missing data mechanism had little impact on the accuracy and pairwise deletion performed comparably well as the more sophisticated imputation methods. In some conditions, especially small-sample cases and when comparison data were used to determine the number of factors, random forest imputation was preferable to other missing data methods, though. Accordingly, depending on data characteristics and the selected factor retention criterion, choosing an appropriate missing data method is crucial to obtain a valid estimate of the number of factors to extract.},

 abstract = {The Well-To-Wheels (WTW) methodology is widely used for policy making in the transportation sector. In this paper updated WTW calculations are provided, relying on 2013 statistic data, for the carbon intensity (CI) of the European electricity mix; detail is provided for electricity consumed in each EU Member State (MS). An interesting aspect presented is the calculation of the GHG content of electricity traded between Countries, affecting the carbon intensity of the electricity consumed at national level. The amount and CI of imported electricity is a key aspect: a Country importing electricity from another Country with a lower CI of electricity will lower, after the trade, its electricity CI, while importing electricity from a Country with a higher CI will raise the CI of the importing Country. In average, the CI of electricity used in EU at low voltage in 2013 was 447 gCO2eq/kWh, which is the 17{\%} less compared to 2009. Then, some examples of calculation of GHG emissions from the use of electric vehicles (EVs) compared to internal combustion engine vehicles are provided. The use of EVs instead of gasoline vehicles can save (about 60{\%} of) GHG in all or in most of the EU MSs, depending on the estimated consumption of EVs. Compared with diesel, EVs show average GHG savings of around 50{\%} and not savings at all in some EU MS.},
